# Final PR #7 scheduler benchmarks

Measured 2026-09-30 on Linux x86_64, 12 available CPUs, Rust 1.97.1 and Node 26.10.0, release builds. Original baseline: `0fa987d8860d620cd1008a84f2a17c9b67c495cd`. Final implementation: `b918b389f7f2c12cdca0844bbd45c0c86ca48d46`. Subsequent commits only document these results.

## Reproduce

```sh
bench/run-scheduler.sh
```

The harness archives the original baseline into a separate source/build directory, copies identical common workloads to both builds, and builds before timing. Baseline and implementation timing runs are sequential. It records the implementation revision in `machine.txt`; use an unchanged source checkout throughout. Linux x64 addon filenames are currently hard-coded. Node admission retries accommodate the original baseline’s occasional post-completion busy race; the final measured run required zero retries.

[Raw JSONL and machine metadata](benchmarks/pr7-final/machine.txt) are stored in `docs/benchmarks/pr7-final/`. Queue workloads use one warmup and 25 batches. Node workloads use 20 warmups and 500 sequential calls per workload. This is one host run, not a confidence interval. Batch latency includes setup, execution, drain and teardown. Rust allocations count allocation/reallocation calls across the entire batch, not bytes or retained memory. Unmeasured Node allocations remain `null`.

| Workload | Baseline batch p50 / p95 / p99 (µs) | Final batch p50 / p95 / p99 (µs) |

Large queues benefit from ordered removal compared with the original vector scan. The small-queue and interpreter results above include regressions; they must not be summarized as a universal speedup. The tree still allocates more than a vector. Cancellation churn in `vm/cancel` repeatedly schedules and cancels one timer, unlike the isolated batch cancellation workload. Promise and mixed-event figures also include checkpoint, wake, root and teardown accounting.

Removing the reverse timer index has direct allocation evidence: the exploratory queue trial changed timer registration/drain allocations for 100 / 1,000 / 10,000 timers from 24 / 177 / 1,680 to 18 / 167 / 1,667. Cancellation batches changed 30 / 188 / 1,693 to 24 / 178 / 1,680. See [trial caveats](benchmarks/pr7-final/trial-notes.txt). Trial wall times were not commit-isolated and are not used as a controlled speedup claim. A small-vector/tree hybrid was not introduced without additional threshold and churn measurements.

## Repeated async execution and awaited host calls

| Workload / owner | Calls/s | p50 / p95 / p99 (ms) | CPU for 500 calls (ms) | Idle CPU / 250 ms (ms) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| trivial-async / Original legacy | 21,364 | 0.0383 / 0.0877 / 0.1531 | 27.139 | 1.630 |
| awaited-host-async / Original legacy | 11,633 | 0.0714 / 0.1848 / 0.3598 | 47.880 | unmeasured |
| trivial-async / Final legacy | 18,821 | 0.0460 / 0.0923 / 0.1584 | 31.176 | 1.627 |
| awaited-host-async / Final legacy | 11,455 | 0.0724 / 0.1776 / 0.3412 | 49.017 | unmeasured |
| trivial-async / Final persistent | 57,170 | 0.0118 / 0.0319 / 0.0612 | 9.585 | 1.148 |
| awaited-host-async / Final persistent | 25,710 | 0.0289 / 0.0614 / 0.1463 | 20.176 | unmeasured |

The original baseline has no `AsyncSession`; its legacy worker is the comparison for persistent ownership. The host-call workload explicitly exposes an async Node callback and awaits it on every execution. Idle CPU is process-wide and includes Node background activity. These figures do not establish Node allocation counts or retained-memory use.

## Real-time timers, wakes and bounds

- 2,500 timer samples: 17,828 jobs/s; lateness p50 / p95 / p99: 41.9 / 84.3 / 292.8 µs; peak queue 100.
- 10,000 ingress samples: 3,011,400 events/s; wake latency p50 / p95 / p99: 1.06 / 5.91 / 12.19 µs; 1713 coalesced wakes; capacity 32; idle thread CPU 3.0 µs / 250 ms.
- vm/timers measured peak queue: 1000.
- vm/cancel measured peak queue: 1.
- vm/promises measured peak queue: 1.

These new-clock/wake metrics have no equivalent original-baseline API, so no baseline timer-lateness or wake-latency ratio is claimed. Browser idle CPU and other operating systems were not measured.
