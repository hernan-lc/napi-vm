# napi-vm Zed extension

A thin launcher for the standalone native language server:

```
Zed extension
  ↓ locate (settings → $PATH) or download the platform binary
napi-vm-lsp
  ↓
napi_vm::lang::LanguageService (Rust core)
```

Node.js is never involved. Nothing is resolved out of the consumer project's
`node_modules`, so the extension behaves identically for npm, pnpm, Electron,
Electron ASAR, Bun-compiled applications, and projects with no `node_modules`
at all.

## How the binary is resolved

1. **Explicitly configured path** — `lsp.napi-vm.binary.path` in Zed settings,
   or the `NAPI_VM_LSP_PATH` environment variable:

   ```json
   {
     "lsp": {
       "napi-vm": {
         "binary": { "path": "/absolute/path/to/napi-vm-lsp" }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **`$PATH`** — a `napi-vm-lsp` visible to the worktree's shell environment.

3. **GitHub Releases** — the platform archive for the latest release
   (`napi-vm-lsp-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz` / `.zip`), extracted into the extension's
   working directory and marked executable. Older versions are pruned.

The executable is never inspected with a text-reading API; it is located by
path or by `which`, and then executed.

## Local development

```bash
cargo build --release --no-default-features --bin napi-vm-lsp
export PATH="$PWD/target/release:$PATH"
```

Then install the `zed-extension/` directory through Zed's dev-extension flow.
Rebuild the extension itself with:

```bash
npm run zed:build   # cargo build --target wasm32-wasip2 --release
```

## Runtime metadata

The language server owns editor intelligence; the application owns runtime
metadata. They meet only at `<workspace>/.napi-vm/runtime.json` plus a Unix
domain socket (Windows: named pipe) — Runtime Protocol v1 — so neither side
depends on the other's filesystem layout.

Start a session to publish live host functions, module exports and observed
event shapes:

```bash
NAPI_VM_SESSION=1 bun examples/hotreload.ts
```

Without a running session no locator exists and the server simply serves
static analysis. No `.napi-vm.json` file is created or read by default.

## Linux compatibility

Releases ship both a glibc build (`napi-vm-lsp-linux-<arch>.tar.gz`) and a
statically linked musl build (`napi-vm-lsp-linux-<arch>-musl.tar.gz`). If the
glibc build reports `GLIBC_x.xx not found` on an older distribution, download
the musl archive and point `lsp.napi-vm.binary.path` at it.

JavaScript keeps Zed's built-in language (and its Tree-sitter highlighting);
this extension only contributes the napi-vm language server.
